    <p>
        I am a Software Architect, Writer, and Technologist. I believe that while technology may feel like a pandora’s
        box, especially in recent times, that it is up to those in the Technology Industry to bring about the betterment
        of mankind, through technology. <i>Looking backwards is never the answer.</i>
    </p>

    <div class=”aside”>
        I’m always looking for a new challenge, and am open to new ideas. If you have a proposal (employment or
        otherwise), please see the <a href="/contact">contact</a> page.

    <h1>Architect</h1>
    <p>
        I call myself a ‘Software Architect’. What does that mean? Well, for me, it means that every piece of software
        I write gets designed first. I use my experience to decide on what overall structure meets the requirements, and
        then pick what tools I’m going to use to build that structure. Every decision I make while writing code is
        thought out, and I attempt to look ahead to where this project is likely to go, and make sure my design will
        accommodate that.
    </p>
    <p>
        I do this universally, usually in my head, or on a whiteboard. From code comments to project layout, to the
        libraries I use, everything is a conscious, reasoned decision. That doesn't mean I always get it <i>right</i>,
        mind you. Reevaluation is part of learning and improving, and what wasn't well suited 6 months ago might be a
        perfect fit now. Everything's a balancing act, and I've gotten pretty good at it.
    </p>

    <h1>Creative</h1>
    <p>
        For me, the most important thing I can do with my life is to create things and share them with the world. Every
        program I write is open source. I openly share my personal writing. When I find a particularly useful solution
        to a problem, I share it with those around me. The point is never “Look what I did”, but rather, “Hey, I think
        you’ll get something out of this.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I am constantly working on new things. I not only have several software projects going, but I am
        getting into 3D printing, I've learned and kept up with CAD software, and I co-author a webcomic with my wife.
        I'm even working on a novel, as well as several short story projects. (Heck, I even run a pen and paper
        roleplaying group once every other week, and the off weeks I play in one.)
    </p>

    <h1>Adaptable</h1>
    <p>
        I believe that the single most important life skill is learning
        <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind">how to change your mind</a>. It’s an
        absolutely essential life skill, and sadly, one of the largest causes for contention and misguided decisions. So
        much pain, strife and horror has happened in this world simply because people didn’t know how to step back,
        accept that they were wrong and that’s ok.
    </p>
    <p>
        I pride myself on the fact that I am aware of my own stubbornness, and am actively improving my abilities in
        this area. I'm not perfect, nor am I even where I want to be, but I strive to improve in this area on a daily
        basis. Additionally, I am working to improve myself as a
        <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality">rationalist</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
        I have been developing software for 14 years. I have professionally developed software for 5 of those. As a
        hobbyist, I've work on everything from PIC microcontrollers, to massively scaling erlang projects. Most recently, I've contributed
    </p>
    <p>
        My specialties are in web technologies and server based solutions. I have architected projects following
        Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions, and worked on much more traditional client/server solutions as well. My
        preferred technologies are <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a>,
        <a href="https://angularjs.org/">angular.js</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>. (I am also a fan of <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a>,
        <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com/">RethinkDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">erlang</a>, though I
        don't get as much of a chance to use those technologies.)

        code, or check out the <a href="https://github.com/Morgul/morgul.github.com">github project</a>. To get a better
        feel, I recommend looking at these other projects of mine on GitHub:
